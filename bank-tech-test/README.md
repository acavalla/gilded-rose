# Bank tech test

This is a mock tech test for week 10 of Maker's Academy. I took a day and a half to build two classes, of which Bank is the dependant, and Transaction the dependency. The trade-off of the dependency introduced by an extra class was to adhere better to the SRP. It made it more complicated as I had to add mocks to inject dependency, but it was a good opportunity to practise my mocking skills.

The rough planning can be seen at the bottom of the readme, and its progress tracked through the commits. I originally planned to have two separate classes for Deposit and Withdrawal, but when I built them out I noticed they were mirroring one another, so to keep things dry I combined them into one and just added a conditional to decide which column (credit/debit) the transaction should go in.

In its current iteration, the date and amount are input manually, and in fact will accept any data, which could be improved. This is an ethical bank which will let you overdraw yourself to an unlimited amount and never charge you any fees, because their being poor is not a good reason to fine someone.

To run this code, please clone the repo; `rspec` will run the test suite.
Please see below for irb demonstration and plans.

## Specification

### Requirements

* You should be able to interact with your code via a REPL like IRB or the JavaScript console.  (You don't need to implement a command line interface that takes input from STDIN.)
* Deposits, withdrawal.
* Account statement (date, amount, balance) printing.
* Data can be kept in memory (it doesn't need to be stored in a database or anything).

### Acceptance criteria

**Given** a client makes a deposit of 1000 on 10-01-2012  
**And** a deposit of 2000 on 13-01-2012  
**And** a withdrawal of 500 on 14-01-2012  
**When** she prints her bank statement  
**Then** she would see

```
date || credit || debit || balance
14/01/2012 || || 500.00 || 2500.00
13/01/2012 || 2000.00 || || 3000.00
10/01/2012 || 1000.00 || || 1000.00
```

## Self-assessment

Once you have completed the challenge and feel happy with your solution, here's a form to help you reflect on the quality of your code: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Q-NnqVObbGLDHxlvbUfeAC7yBCf3eCjTmz6GOqC9Aeo/edit

## Planning

Class: Bank
Methods: transaction [create Transaction class], statement
Instance variables: balance, transactions [array of Transaction class]

Class: Transaction
Keeps track of amounts, date, current balance
Methods: initialize
Instance variables: details hash { amount, date, balance }
